# PHP include and require Statements
* include và require statement là giống nhau,, trừ lỗi.

    + require will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script
    + include will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue

* Use require when the file is required by the application.

* Use include when the file is not required and application should continue when file is not found.
